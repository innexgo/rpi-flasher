# RPI-Flasher

Associates RFID Sticker UUIDs with student IDs. To use, first install python packages `mfrc522` and `requests`. After that, clone this repo onto the pi. You can use `setup_rpi.sh` to set up the raspberry pi's boot sector from the command line. Adds the wpa_supplicant as well as the innexgo-flasher.json that is needed.
